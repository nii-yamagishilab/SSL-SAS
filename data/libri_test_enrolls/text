1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ENNIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DEDALUS
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
121-121726-0001 HARANGUE THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
121-121726-0002 ANGOR PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR
121-121726-0003 HAY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW
121-121726-0006 HEREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
121-121726-0007 HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE RACES
121-121726-0008 HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THE WALK
121-121726-0009 HOTEL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR QUARTERS
121-121726-0010 HOUSECLEANING A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0011 HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121-121726-0012 HUSSY WOMAN AND BOND TIE
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLOA WHAT'S THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
1580-141083-0052 OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
1995-1826-0002 JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0007 FIND SOME CRESSWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT UNDERGROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKENED
1995-1826-0025 SOME TIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010 OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
237-126133-0011 ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD
237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0016 OH NO JASPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ICHTHYOSAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4446-2271-0000 MAINHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSEWHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0011 O VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER YOU CAN GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MAP
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HORTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SANDFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR ENTRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
5105-28233-0000 LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
5105-28233-0001 HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN INTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRE
5105-28233-0007 BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE
5142-33396-0003 THE REST OF YOU OFF A VIKING HE HAD THREE SHIPS
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I CARVED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0009 THERE STAND SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES
5142-33396-0010 IN THE STERN I CURVED THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE HEAD
5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR HORNS AND SAID
5142-33396-0018 MY DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD
5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SMELLS OF SMOKE A SHIP SMELLS OF FROLIC
5142-33396-0021 UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH AND MUCH FROLIC
5142-33396-0023 IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0026 MY MEN LAUGHED YES A STINGY HOST
5142-33396-0028 ON A BENCH IN A FAR CORNER WERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER
5142-33396-0035 DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A LORDLY GUEST BEFORE I WENT ON
5142-33396-0037 HAKON THERE SHALL BE YOUR CONSTANT COMPANION FRIEND FARMER
5142-33396-0041 SO I SET GUARDS OVER EVERY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
5142-33396-0043 THEIR EYES DANCED BIG THORLEIF STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIMSELF
5142-33396-0046 BY THE BEARD OF ODIN I CRIED YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE A MAN
5142-33396-0049 HERE FRIEND TAKE IT AND HE THRUST IT INTO THE FARMER'S HAND
5142-33396-0050 MAY YOU DRINK HEART'S EASE FROM IT FOR MANY YEARS
5142-33396-0053 I TOOK FIVE GREAT BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
5142-33396-0056 HERE THEY SAID IS A RASCAL WHO HAS BEEN HARRYING OUR COASTS
5142-33396-0058 A ROBBER VIKING SAID THE KING AND SCOWLED AT ME
5142-33396-0062 NOW SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM AND SMILED AND SAID
5142-33396-0064 YOUR FATHER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN LOOKED AT YOUR MOTHER AND SMILED
5142-33396-0068 SO I LIVED AND NOW AM YOUR TOOTH THRALL WELL IT IS THE LUCK OF WAR
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0015 I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
61-70968-0001 GIVE NOT SO EARNEST A MIND TO THESE MUMMERIES CHILD
61-70968-0002 A GOLDEN FORTUNE AND A HAPPY LIFE
61-70968-0004 ALSO THERE WAS A STRIPLING PAGE WHO TURNED INTO A MAID
61-70968-0005 THIS WAS SO SWEET A LADY SIR AND IN SOME MANNER I DO THINK SHE DIED
61-70968-0007 SISTER NELL DO YOU HEAR THESE MARVELS
61-70968-0008 TAKE YOUR PLACE AND LET US SEE WHAT THE CRYSTAL CAN SHOW TO YOU
61-70968-0009 LIKE AS NOT YOUNG MASTER THOUGH I AM AN OLD MAN
61-70968-0012 CRIES OF A NOTTINGHAM A NOTTINGHAM
61-70968-0016 AND THEN THEY BECAME VEXED AND WOULD HAVE SNATCHED YOUR PURSE FROM US
61-70968-0029 THE SQUIRE HELPED TO THRUST THEM ALL IN AND ENTERED SWIFTLY HIMSELF
61-70968-0031 SILENCE YOU KNAVE CRIED MONTFICHET
61-70968-0036 GEORGE MONTFICHET WILL NEVER FORGET THIS DAY
61-70968-0037 WHAT IS YOUR NAME LORDING ASKED THE LITTLE STROLLER PRESENTLY
61-70968-0039 AND MINE IS WILL STUTELEY SHALL WE BE COMRADES
61-70968-0040 RIGHT WILLINGLY FOR BETWEEN US WE HAVE WON THE BATTLE ANSWERED ROBIN
61-70968-0042 MONTFICHET CALLED OUT FOR ROBIN TO GIVE HIM AN ARM
61-70968-0045 PRAY FOLLOW US WITH MINE AND MY LORD SHERIFF'S MEN
61-70968-0046 NOTTINGHAM CASTLE WAS REACHED AND ADMITTANCE WAS DEMANDED
61-70968-0048 AND HENRY MIGHT RETURN TO ENGLAND AT ANY MOMENT
61-70968-0051 BEG ME A ROOM OF THE SHERIFF CHILD QUICKLY
61-70968-0052 BUT WHO IS THIS FELLOW PLUCKING AT YOUR SLEEVE
61-70968-0053 HE IS MY ESQUIRE EXCELLENCY RETURNED ROBIN WITH DIGNITY
61-70968-0056 THE WINE DID CERTAINLY BRING BACK THE COLOR TO THE SQUIRE'S CHEEKS
61-70968-0060 NO THANKS I AM GLAD TO GIVE YOU SUCH EASY HAPPINESS
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0011 I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 OH SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOR
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE N EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0019 SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BOOKKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED BEFORE THEM
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADDED MORE
6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY'S OUR MASTER'S AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAOUL COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERRATED
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AIGNAN AND VILLEROY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
7127-75946-0010 YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILETTE BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE BALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0012 THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCHY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM HERE
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HOLLAN NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAN WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAN
8463-287645-0004 JOHN WESLEY COMBASH JACOB TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER
8463-287645-0005 A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SLAVES A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTERWARDS
8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0008 AS USUAL NOTHING WAS DONE IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT
8463-287645-0009 I NEVER KNEW OF BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD EVER PLEASE HIM
8463-287645-0010 HE WORKED ME VERY HARD HE WANTED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME
8463-287645-0011 SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE WITH NO REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY
8463-287645-0012 SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOB'S UNVARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
8463-287645-0013 AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACOB'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM

8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THE BOOLOOROO GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
8555-284447-0005 THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
8555-284447-0007 THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
8555-284447-0009 MORNIN GIRLS HOPE YE FEEL AS WELL AS YE LOOK
8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF PATCHING CAP'N BILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BOOLOOROO
8555-284447-0020 THE GOAT'S WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
8555-284447-0022 I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MATE AS SAVED ME FROM THE KNIFE

908-31957-0009 AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILLED A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR
908-31957-0012 IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUST LOSE ONE JOY BY HIS LIFE'S STAR FORETOLD
908-31957-0013 SLOW TO WORLD GREETINGS QUICK WITH ITS O LIST WHEN THE ANGELS SPEAK
908-31957-0014 A RING OF AMETHYST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAINER TO MY SIGHT THAN THAT FIRST KISS
