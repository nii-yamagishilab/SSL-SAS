1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE

1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN

1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH

1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE

1673-143397-0004 ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT
1673-143397-0005 A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED

1673-143397-0020 A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMMYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NESTORIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES

1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION

1988-24833-0015 YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA
1988-24833-0023 TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
1988-24833-0028 HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
2035-147961-0026 THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY
2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
2035-147961-0037 EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA
2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
2035-152373-0010 THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST
2035-152373-0016 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
2035-152373-0017 SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
2035-152373-0018 NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD
2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
2277-149896-0002 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION
2277-149896-0004 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
2277-149896-0009 WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
2277-149896-0025 HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 GEORGE
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
3081-166546-0049 BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
3081-166546-0065 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
3081-166546-0073 YES
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES
3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0017 THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
3536-8226-0031 AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
3576-138058-0003 WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
3576-138058-0004 DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
3576-138058-0006 HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED
3576-138058-0017 HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO SPARE FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
3576-138058-0018 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
3576-138058-0019 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
3576-138058-0020 NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACQUEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE
3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BALVASTRO
3576-138058-0024 ON PERCEIVING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE RENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVENS RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART
3576-138058-0025 CRUEL RECKLESS WOMAN SHE CRIED HOW EASILY WERT THOU MOVED TO CARRY OUT A THOUGHT SO WICKED
3576-138058-0026 O HUSBAND WHOSE UNHAPPY FATE IN BEING MINE HATH BORNE THEE FROM THE MARRIAGE BED TO THE GRAVE
3576-138058-0027 THE SERVANTS WEPT CLAUDIA SWOONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE SEEMED A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABODE OF MISFORTUNE
3576-138058-0028 CLAUDIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBESS WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE
3576-138058-0029 CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS
3576-138058-0030 SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING
3576-138058-0031 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAN
3576-138058-0032 SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THREE REALS
3576-138058-0033 AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SQUIRES WHO WERE POSTED AS SENTINELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THEIR CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SENOR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BARCELONA
3576-138058-0034 WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIETEST HEARTS
3576-138058-0035 AND IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIRE TO SHORTEN THE JOURNEY AND PUT YOURSELF EASILY IN THE WAY OF SALVATION COME WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BECOME A KNIGHT ERRANT A CALLING WHEREIN SO MANY HARDSHIPS AND MISHAPS ARE ENCOUNTERED THAT IF THEY BE TAKEN AS PENANCES THEY WILL LODGE YOU IN HEAVEN IN A TRICE
3576-138058-0036 AND NOW THE SQUIRES DESPATCHED TO MAKE THE PRIZE CAME UP BRINGING WITH THEM TWO GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK TWO PILGRIMS ON FOOT AND A COACH FULL OF WOMEN WITH SOME SIX SERVANTS ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM AND A COUPLE OF MULETEERS WHOM THE GENTLEMEN HAD WITH THEM
3576-138058-0037 THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED
3576-138058-0038 THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
3576-138058-0039 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS
3576-138058-0040 THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SMILAX WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
3853-163249-0022 YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMMICK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE VITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SO
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERIN CREETERS NAMES
3853-163249-0033 NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANN LIZY
3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHY BE YOU SATISFIED
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
5338-284437-0014 ARE YOU A GIANT
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
5338-284437-0017 CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO OUR WAY IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS

6313-66129-0007 I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
6313-66129-0008 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY

6313-66129-0012 THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT
6313-66129-0013 BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
6313-66129-0014 SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
6313-66129-0019 A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
6313-66129-0020 THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN
6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
6313-66129-0024 THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
6313-66129-0027 THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
6313-66129-0028 TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
6313-66129-0031 HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
6313-66129-0032 WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
6313-66129-0033 ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
6313-76958-0001 EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
6313-76958-0002 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
6313-76958-0003 A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
6313-76958-0007 WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
6313-76958-0008 HUMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS
6313-76958-0009 THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
6313-76958-0010 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS
6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
6313-76958-0015 STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
6313-76958-0017 LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
6313-76958-0018 HI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
6313-76958-0019 STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
6313-76958-0020 WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
6313-76958-0021 KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
6313-76958-0023 GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
6313-76958-0025 A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STOLIDLY
6313-76958-0026 HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY
6313-76958-0027 OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN
6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLEMAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
6313-76958-0029 PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
6313-76958-0030 HOW ASKED TAD
6313-76958-0031 WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HAUT BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
6345-93302-0028 HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
6345-93306-0015 WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE
6345-93306-0025 IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO
7850-281318-0018 CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS
8842-302201-0012 IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY PHANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
8842-302203-0004 AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOK'D AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY O LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESS'D ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPP'D INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE WILDERING PHANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY PRIMAVERA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGH'D AND LAUGH'D AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANGLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GODHEAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUINCI IMPARA A STUPIRTI
8842-304647-0002 IN FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEAD SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE HOW ALL HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR MEN HOW HE AT LAST TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WHELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND TO HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES AND BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FOUL TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 IL POPOLO E UNA BESTIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEARS VAIN
8842-304647-0007 MOST WONDERFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF RUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LUST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAN AS CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES AND SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CAN TYRANNISE
8842-304647-0012 DUE TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
8842-304647-0013 THOU LIKE ARCTURUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDEST THY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
